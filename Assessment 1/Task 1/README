# Cyberpunk: Math Protocol

Welcome, Operator. Your neural link is now online. Solve sequences of math problems to breach nodes and capture data. Precision and speed are critical.

---

## Objective

- Solve a sequence of math problems to successfully **BREACH** nodes.
- Each correct answer captures data and increases your **Trace Data** score.
- Complete all 10 nodes to finish the simulation.
- Achieve the highest score possible to earn the top performance rank.

## Security Levels (Difficulty)

Choose your BREACH protocol:

1. **LOW SECURITY (Easy)**
   - Numbers: 0–9
   - Timer: None (unlimited time)
   - Operations: +, -, ×, ÷

2. **MEDIUM SECURITY (Moderate)**
   - Numbers: 10–99
   - Timer: 12 seconds per node
   - Operations: +, -, ×, ÷
   - Failing or slow responses triggers node failure

3. **HIGH SECURITY (Advanced)**
   - Numbers: 100–999
   - Timer: 16 seconds per node
   - Operations: +, -, ×, ÷
   - Requires rapid and accurate calculations; multiple failures reduce your score

## Interface Overview

- **NODE MATRIX**: Left panel showing simulated hex traces (visual only).  
- **BREACH INTERFACE (center)**:
  - **Question Label**: Displays the current math problem.
  - **Progress Label**: Shows your current node (e.g., `Sequence: 3 / 10`).
  - **Timer Bar**: Countdown for Medium and High Security nodes.
  - **Entry Box**: Type your answer here. Press **Enter** or **DEPLOY ANSWER** to submit.
  - **TERMINATE SESSION**: Abort the current BREACH and return to the menu.
- **Feedback Panel (Right)**: Displays node status and error messages.

## Rules for Answering

- Only **integer values** are accepted. Invalid inputs trigger a warning.
- **Correct Answer**:
  - First attempt: +10 points
  - Second attempt (if first attempt was wrong): +5 points
  - Feedback: “Status: Node cracked. Data captured.”
- **Incorrect Answer**:
  - First attempt: Retry allowed; feedback shows number of attempts.
  - Second attempt or timeout: Node fails, and a failure sound is played.
- **Timer Expiration**:
  - Medium & High Security nodes have a countdown.
  - If time runs out, the node automatically fails.

## Scoring & Ranks

- Maximum score: 100 points (10 nodes × 10 points each)
- Performance ranks:
  - **S** – 100 points
  - **A+** – 90–99 points
  - **A** – 80–89 points
  - **B** – 70–79 points
  - **C** – 60–69 points
  - **D** – 50–59 points
  - **F** – below 50 points
- Rank is displayed at the end of the simulation along with total score.

## Tips for Operators

- Plan your answer before typing; high-security nodes are fast.
- Use mental shortcuts for multiplication and division.
- Watch the timer closely; mistakes waste seconds.
- Only integers are valid; decimals or fractions are rejected.
- Two attempts per node maximum. After that, the node fails.

## Game Flow

1. Launch the game.
2. Select a BREACH protocol: Easy, Moderate, or High.
3. The node grid displays a randomized “TRACE ID” for immersion.
4. Solve each math problem within the time limit (if applicable).
5. Monitor feedback and progress.
6. Complete all 10 nodes to receive your score and performance rank.
7. Optionally, return to the menu to try a different BREACH protocol.
